## :dart: About ##

This repository contains several jupyter notebooks for a project that explores the relationships between medication, patient characteristics, and patient outcomes. The project includes data cleaning, ontology building, and machine learning models for clustering and link prediction.

## :sparkles: Features ##

The project includes the following files: \
:heavy_check_mark: Feature 1; data_cleaning.ipynb: cleans the opiods_data_original_xlxs and also adds another dataset to it (sider_ouput.xlxl) and merges them to one file \
:heavy_check_mark: Feature 2; ontology_medsur.ipynb: builds an ontology from the dataet and exports it all the generated triples as a csv ttl and rdf file \
:heavy_check_mark: Feature 3; clustering_chars.ipynb: performs clustering machine learning on the data set medsur.csv based on patient characteristics using the ampligraph model \
:heavy_check_mark: Feature 4; clustering_symps.ipynb: performs clustering machine learning on the data set medsur.csv based on patient symptoms using the ampligraph model \
:heavy_check_mark: Feature 5; link_prediction.ipynb: performs 4 link predictions: \
outcome recovery for different weight groups of patients \
outcome recovery for different age groups of patients \
symptoms for different types of prescribed drugs \
side-effect occurrence for different types of prescribed drugs \
For each prediction, a CSV file is exported containing the prediction scores and probabilities for each group or drug type.
