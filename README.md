## :dart: About ##

This project is aimed at providing a knowledge graph representation of the drug-medication interactions using the Medsur Dataset from Hetionet [1] and the Side Effect Resource (SIDER) from the MeddrA [2] databases. It uses various knowledge graph embedding techniques. These embeddings can then be used for various downstream tasks such as clustering, link prediction, and visualization. 

AmpliGraph Models
AmpliGraph is an open-source Python library for learning embeddings of entities and relations in a KG. It provides a set of models that can be used to generate embeddings. In this project link prediction is performed on the knowledge graph using the ComplEx model.

Clustering
Clustering is a technique used to group similar entities in a KG together based on their properties or relationships. In this project, we use clustering to identify groups of related entities in the KG. This projects focused on the following clustering:
- cluster patients based on their characteristics (agegroup and weightgroup) \
- cluster symptoms 

Link Prediction
Link prediction is the task of predicting missing relationships between entities in a KG. In this project, we use link prediction to predict missing relationships between entities in the KG. The projects focused on the following link predictions:
- outcome recovery for different weight groups of patients \
- outcome recovery for different age groups of patients \
- symptoms for different types of prescribed drugs \
- side-effect occurrence for different types of prescribed drugs \

## :sparkles: Features ##
This repository contains several jupyter notebooks for a project that explores the relationships between medication, patient characteristics, and patient outcomes. The project includes data cleaning, ontology building, and machine learning models for clustering and link prediction.

The project includes the following files: \
:heavy_check_mark: Feature 1; data_cleaning.ipynb: cleans the opiods_data_original_xlxs and also adds another dataset to it (sider_ouput.xlxl) and merges them to one file \
:heavy_check_mark: Feature 2; ontology_medsur.ipynb: builds an ontology from the dataet and exports it all the generated triples as a csv ttl and rdf file \
:heavy_check_mark: Feature 3; clustering_chars.ipynb: performs clustering machine learning on the mesur triples based on patient characteristics using the ampligraph model \
:heavy_check_mark: Feature 4; clustering_symps.ipynb: performs clustering machine learning on the medsur triples based on patient symptoms using the ampligraph model \
:heavy_check_mark: Feature 5; link_prediction.ipynb: build an ampligraph model on the medsur triples and performs the link prediction. For each prediction, a CSV file is exported containing the prediction scores and probabilities for each group or drug type.
